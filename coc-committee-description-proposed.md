**PROPOSED DRAFT: This proposed working draft is under review and development by the [Code of Conduct Working Group](https://github.com/cncf/wg-coc). It is not a final document. If you would like to propose changes to this document, please do so by opening a pull request, opening an issue, or posting a comment. The first version of this proposed draft was contributed by the [Interim CNCF Code of Conduct Committee](https://www.cncf.io/conduct/committee/) and is based on the interim committee’s own [committee description](https://www.cncf.io/conduct/committee/).**

# CNCF Code of Conduct Committee

## Purpose

The CNCF Code of Conduct Committee (“CoC Committee”) responds to, investigates, and resolves [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md) incidents.

The Jurisdiction and Escalation Policy describes the CoC Committee’s relationship to the Linux Foundation (LF) events staff, who enforce the [Linux Foundation Events Code of Conduct](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/about/code-of-conduct/), and project-level Code of Conduct responders (e.g., the Kubernetes Code of Conduct Committee).

## Members

The Interim CoC Committee consists of 3 community members, 1 LF Events staff member, and 2 CNCF staff members. The members of the interim committee are listed below:

**Community Members:**

-   [Name 1]
-   [Name 2]
-   [Name 3]  
      
**Alternate Community Members:**

-   [Name 1]
-   [Name 2]
-   [Name 3]  
      
**CNCF Staff:**

-   [Name 1]
-   [Name 2]

**Linux Foundation Staff:**

-   [Name 1]
    
## Alternates  
To ensure that multiple Community Members are involved in resolution of each incident, alternates participate when one or more of the primary Community Members listed above are unavailable (e.g., due to illness) or recuse themselves due to a conflict of interest. Similarly, LF and CNCF may appoint an alternate for a particular incident if one of their representatives listed above is unavailable or has a conflict of interest.

  

## How CoC Committee Members Are Selected

[Eligibility requirements and procedures for electing or appointing CoC Committee Members (both primary & alternates) to be discussed among CoC Working Group]

## How Decisions Are Made

Decisions of the Interim CoC Committee shall be made by consensus whenever possible. In the event consensus cannot be reached, decisions shall be made by majority vote of non-conflicted members of the Interim CoC Committee. A decision to take temporary interim action in the event of an emergency may be taken by any individual Interim CoC Committee member acting in good faith, and the Interim CoC Committee shall review such action and decide whether to confirm or reverse such action. Any permanent action shall require approval of a majority of non-conflicted members of the Interim CoC Committee. The Interim CoC Committee may take action without a meeting if a majority of non-conflicted members express agreement in writing (e.g., email or slack) and none of the non-conflicted CoC Committee members either object to the proposed action or request a meeting to discuss the proposed action within 24 hours after the action is first proposed to the CoC Committee. In the absence of such agreement in writing, the CoC Committee may only take action during or after a meeting takes place at which the proposed action is discussed and agreed to by consensus or voted upon by a quorum of the non-conflicted members. A majority of non-conflicted members shall be deemed a quorum for purposes of a meeting. See the “Conflict of Interest” section of the Incident Resolution Procedures for more information.

## External Support Resources

The Interim CoC Committee may, in its discretion, engage external mediators, investigators, advisors, and consultants as needed to assist with resolution of CoC Incidents. Any such external resources shall not have a vote, and shall be required to maintain confidentiality in accordance with our Confidentiality Policy.
